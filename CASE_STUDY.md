## 3. Methodology

### Step 1: Data Preparation & Feature Engineering (`load.py`)

#### Merging Strategy
1. Started with orders table (200 rows)
2. Left join delivery performance
3. Merged routes, costs, and feedback
4. Enriched with warehouse efficiency metrics

#### Advanced Feature Engineering (14 Features Created)

**1. Carrier Reliability Score**
```python
carrier_reliability = ontime_rate * 0.7 + avg_rating/5 * 0.3
```
- Combines on-time performance and customer ratings
- Normalized 0-1 scale

**2. Route Risk Index**
```python
route_risk = traffic_risk * 0.6 + weather_risk * 0.4
```
- Weighted combination of traffic delays and weather impact
- Higher values indicate riskier routes

**3. Order Complexity Score**
```python
complexity = (order_value/max_value) * 0.3 + 
             special_handling * 0.4 + 
             (distance/max_distance) * 0.3
```
- Multi-factor complexity assessment
- Accounts for value, handling requirements, distance

**4. Cost Efficiency Metrics**
- Total delivery cost (sum of 7 cost components)
- Cost per kilometer
- Fuel efficiency ratio

**5. Temporal Features**
- Day of week (0-6)
- Month of year
- Weekend order flag
- Month-end flag

**6. Warehouse Efficiency**
```python
efficiency = (current_stock / reorder_level).clip(0, 2) / 2
```
- Stock availability ratio normalized to 0-1
- Matched by origin warehouse and product category

**7. Business Flags**
- High-value order (top 25% by value)
- International route flag
- Quality issue flag
- Special handling flag

**Output**: `master_logistics_data.csv` (200 rows √ó 76 columns)

   - Limits model accuracy to 46.7%
   - More data needed for production

2. **Model Performance**
   - 35.7% recall means 64% of delays not caught
   - ROC-AUC 0.42 below ideal 0.8+
   - Requires 10x more training data

3. **Limited Carriers**
   - Only 7 carriers in dataset
   - May not generalize to new carriers
   - Need more diverse carrier data

4. **Static Predictions**
   - No real-time order tracking
   - Predictions made at order placement

5. **Simplified Cost Model**
   - Delay costs estimated (5% penalty)
   - Customer loss assumptions fixed
   - Actual costs may vary

6. **API Dependency**
   - AI agents require Groq API key
   - Internet connection needed
   - Potential rate limits

### Data Constraints

- **Geographic Coverage**: Limited to India and Southeast Asia
- **Time Period**: Single snapshot, no longitudinal data
